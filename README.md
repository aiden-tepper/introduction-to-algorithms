# introduction-to-algorithms
This repository holds the code I wrote for all the projects completed in my Introduction to Algorithms course, taken second semester sophomore year (Spring 2021)

Course description: Basic paradigms for the design and analysis of efficient algorithms: greed, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, reductions, and the use of randomness. Computational intractability including typical NP-complete problems and ways to deal with them.
